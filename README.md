## Challenges We Ran Into

During the development of GigglyGuru Grove, we encountered a cross-origin error in the backend server. This issue typically arises when one server requests resources from another server. We resolved this problem by incorporating `cors` as a middleware in our server, ensuring smooth communication between different parts of our application.
